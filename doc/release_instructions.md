## Requirements

NOTE! At the moment, we require the release script to be run on an ubuntu machine.

This is because of a dependency on CGO via [this bug](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/841)

(We don't want to enable CGO in part because it doesn't play nice with macOS for us)

You'll need the following credentials / tools:

- A GitHub *Personal Access Token* with **repo** access
  - You can get your personal oauth token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Add your GITHUB token as env variable in your profile. This is required by goreleaser
  - Eg. in ~/.bash_profile add the following line `export GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR-GH-TOKEN"`
- access to `homebrew-tap` and `www` repositories
- S3 credentials
- A dockerhub account, with write access to
  [pachyderm](https://hub.docker.com/u/pachyderm/) (run `docker login`)
- `goreleaser`
    - on linux:
    ```bash
    pushd /usr/local/
    curl -sfL https://install.goreleaser.com/github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser.sh | sudo sh
    popd
    ```
    - on mac: `brew install goreleaser/tap/goreleaser`
- `silversearcher`
    - run: `apt-get install -y silversearcher-ag` on Linux
    -      `brew install the_silver_searcher` on mac

If you're doing a custom release (off a branch that isn't master), [skip to the section at the bottom](#custom-release)

## Releasing

1) Make sure the HEAD commit (that you're about to release) has a passing build on travis.

2) Make sure that you have no uncommitted files in the current branch. Note that `make doc` (next step) will fail if there are any uncommitted changes in the current branch

3) Update client version. Commit these changes locally. You will push to GitHub in a later step.
    - Note: `make VERSION_ADDITIONAL= install` builds new pachctl binary with the correct version string. The pachctl version is used in several steps.
    - [Required for Major, Minor, and Patch releases]
      - `src/client/version/client.go` version values
        - for a major release, increment the MajorVersion and set the MinorVersion and MicroVersion to 0 --> eg. 2.0.0
        - for a minor release, leave the MajorVersion unchanged, increment the MinorVersion, and set the MicroVersion to 0 --> eg. 1.10.0
        - for a patch release, leave the MajorVersion and MinorVersion unchanged and increment the MicroVersion --> eg. 1.9.8
```
> make VERSION_ADDITIONAL= install
> git add src/client/version/client.go
> git commit -m"Increment version for $(pachctl version --client-only) release"
```

4) Update dash compatibility version. Commit these changes locally. You will push to GitHub in a later step.
    - Note: The update to "latest" will cause dash CI to default run with the
    -       release pointed to be latest
    -       The latest link is only update for Major/Minor/Point releases.
    -       In order to test a new version of dash with RC/Alpha/Beta/Custom
    -       release, modify the deployment manifest to test it manually

```
> make dash-compatibility
> git add etc/compatibility
> git commit -m"Update dash compatibility for $(pachctl version --client-only) release"
```

5) Run `make doc` or `make VERSION_ADDITIONAL=-<rc/version suffix> doc-custom` with the new version values.
    - This is only done for Major or Minor releases. We don't publish docs for alpha/beta/rc or custom releases
    - Note in particular:
        - You can also run just `make release-custom` to use the commit hash as the version suffix.
        - Make sure you add any newly created (untracked) doc files, in addition to docs that have been updated (`git commit -a` might not get everything)

6) At this point, all of our auto-generated documentation should be updated. You will push to GitHub in a later step.
```
> git add doc
> git commit -m"Run make doc for $(pachctl version --client-only)"
```

7) Regenerate the golden deployment manifests and commit it locally. You will push to GitHub in a later step.
```
> make regenerate-test-deploy-manifests
> git commit -a -m"Regenerate golden deployment manifests for $(pachctl version --client-only)"
```

8) Update the change log in the branch and commit it locally. You will push to GitHub in later step.
    - Copy the release notes text into the CHANGELOG.md file.
    - [changelog](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
```
> git commit -a -m"Update change log for $(pachctl version --client-only)"
```

9) Push changes to remote branch or master. All changes for the release are in the branch.
```
> git push
```

10) Run `make point-release` or `make VERSION_ADDITIONAL=-rc1 release-candidate`
    - To make alpha/beta/rc releases use...
        - `make VERSION_ADDITIONAL=-alpha1 release-candidate` or
        - `make VERSION_ADDITIONAL=-beta1 release-candidate` or
        - `make VERSION_ADDITIONAL=-rc1 release-candidate`

11) Update the
[release's notes](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases)

12) Post the update on the #users channel.

### New major or minor releases

In the case of a new major or minor release (x.0.0 or 1.x.0), you will need
to make a couple of additional changes:

Make sure you are on master
```
> git checkout master
```

1) Update `src/client/version/client.go` with the new version.
```
> make VERSION_ADDITIONAL= install
> git add src/client/version/client.go
> git commit -m"Increment version for $(pachctl version --client-only) release"
```

2) Regenerate the golden manifests: `make regenerate-test-deploy-manifests`.

3) Write up the extract/restore functionality:

    - Copy the protobuf from the prior release into `src/client/admin`.
    - Update `src/client/admin/admin.proto` to include the operations for the
      prior release.
    - Run `make proto` to rebuild the protos.
    - Add a converter to `src/server/admin/server`, e.g. `convert_1_11.go`.
    - Update the admin client (`src/client/admin.go`) and admin server
      (`src/server/admin/server/api_server.go`.)

  Look to the extract/restore functionality for other versions as a basis to
  build off of. Frequently, it's just a matter of copy/pasting that code and
  updating some names.

```
> git commit -am "Added placeholder files for extract/restore functionality for <next version>"
> git push
```

4) Create a new branch off master called `<major>.<minor>.x` and push it to
   origin.
    - Checkout master to be on the latest and make sure you don't have any local changes
    - Create the new branch
    - Push the new branch

```
> git checkout master
> git branch <major>.<minor>.x
> git push origin -u <major>.<minor>.x
```

### If the release failed

You'll need to delete the *release* and the *release tag* in github. Navigate to
`https://www.github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm` and click on the *Releases* tab.
Click on the big, blue version number corresponding to the release you want to
delete, and you should be redirected to a page with just that release, and red
"Delete" button on the top right. Click the delete button

From here, go back to the list of Pachyderm releases, and click "tags". Click
on the tag for the release you want to delete, and then click "delete" again to
delete the tag.

At this point, you can re-run the release process when you're ready.

## Rolling back a release

If a release has a problem and needs to be withdrawn, the steps in rolling back a release are similar to the steps under "If the release failed". In general, you'll need to:
- Delete the tag and GitHub Release for both the bad release *and the most recent good release*
- Re-release the previous version (to update homebrew)

All of these can be accomplished by:
- Following the steps under "If the release failed" for deleting the tag and GitHub release for both the bad release
- Checking out the git commit associated with the most recent good release (`git checkout tags/v<good release>`). Save this commit SHA (`git rev-list tags/v<good> --max-count=1`), in case you need it later, as we'll be deleting the tag.
- Delete the tag and GitHub release for the last good release (the one you just checked out)
- Syncing your local Git tags with the set of tags on Github (either re-clone the Pachyderm repo, or run `git tag -l | xargs git tag -d; git fetch origin master --tags`). This prevents the release process from failing with `tag already exists`.
- Run `make point-release` (or follow the release process for custom releases)

## Custom release

Occasionally we have a need for a custom release off a non master branch. This is usually because some features we need to supply to users that are incompatible with features on master, but the features on master we need to keep longer term.

Assuming the prerequisites are met, making a custom release should simply be a matter of running `make custom-release`. This will create a release like `v1.2.3-2342345aefda9879e87ad`, which can be installed like:

```
$ curl -o /tmp/pachctl.deb -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v1.11.5/pachctl_1.11.5_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i /tmp/pachctl.deb
```

Or for mac/brew:

```
# Where 1.7 is the major.minor version of the release you just did,
# and you use the right commit SHA as well in the URL
$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pachyderm/homebrew-tap/1.7.0-5a590ad9d8e9a09d4029f0f7379462620cf589ee/pachctl@1.7.rb
```
